[AddOn] TrintyAdmin Reforged for 11.1.7
:bell: [Addon Release] TrinityAdmin – A Modern GM Interface for TrinityCore (WoW 11.1.7)
Hello TrinityCore community,

After many months of development, I’m proud to share TrinityAdmin, a fully reworked and upgraded GM addon designed for TrinityCore servers running World of Warcraft 11.1.0.

:hammer_and_wrench: A Revival of the Original
This project is a modern revival of the original TrinityAdmin addon by NixAJ, which hadn’t been updated in over five years. I took the base concept and reforged the entire code, rebuilt the interface using Ace3, and added dozens of features to bring it up to modern standards.

:bullseye: Key Features:

Complete UI built with Ace3, clean and responsive
Quick access to all GM commands
Advanced tools for managing players, creatures, items, tickets, and more
Full quest, spell, aura and teleportation utilities
In-game search, filters, and action logs
Fully compatible with WoW 11.1.0
Multilingual-ready

Due to the significant development effort, the addon is available through a referral-based access system (free of charge).
